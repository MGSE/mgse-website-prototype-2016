<p>Offering personalised learning experiences that link theory with practical applications, you will get a taste of another discipline and develop new life skills, such as mentoring and professional communication, that are transferrable to any career.  With opportunities to get in-school experience, participate in camps and workshops, or undertake specialised site visits, you will enjoy a range of experiences and discover new ways of thinking.</p>
<p>Our breadth subjects are flexible and most can be taken individually or part of a track, at any level of your degree (subject to degree requirements). They are all 12.5 points and count towards your undergraduate degree breadth study requirements.</p>
<p>Our students come from all areas of the university including the Arts, science, commerce, biomedicine and environments, with 87% of students saying they found their breadth subject intellectually stimulating and 92% saying they learned new ideas that could be applied to practice <small>(2015 Student Experience Survey results)</small>.</p>

                        <p>I did this subject because I wanted to explore what teaching is like. I’ve found the subject really fun; doing science in primary classrooms has been great. One girl enjoyed the experiments we did in class so much that she went home and changed the test to make a new discovery – then she came back to school and we discussed what she had learned. It was really exciting to get such a positive response to my lesson from a ten-year-old.</p>
