            <h3>Start year intake</h3>
            <p>The core program comprises four semesters over two years. You can choose to exit after the third semester with a Graduate Diploma in Teaching, which will qualify you to teach in early childhood settings (children aged 0-5 years) only.
            </p>

            <p><b>In your fourth semester, you can choose from one of three options to gain the full masters:</b></p>
            <ol>
                <li>Early Years: receive dual registration to teach in early childhood settings and primary schools
                </li>
                <li>Early Childhood (professional development): specialise in an area of interest, such as special education, and receive registration to teach in early childhood settings
                </li>
                <li>Early Childhood (research): research a topic of interest, and receive registration to teach in early childhood settings.
                </li>
            </ol>
            <p>These options can be completed up to five years after completing the Graduate Diploma.</p>
            <h2>Career outcomes</h2>
            <p>The Graduate Diploma in Teaching (Early Childhood) and the Master of Teaching (Early Childhood) have been approved by <a href="http://www.acecqa.gov.au/" target="_blank">The Australian Children's Education and Care Quality Authority</a> (ACECQA) and successful completion qualifies you to work in children&#8217;s services in Australia (with children aged 0 &#8211; 5).&nbsp;</p>
            <p>If you complete the Early Years option you will be qualified to work in children&#8217;s services plus gain provisional registration with the <a href="http://vit.vic.edu.au/" target="_blank">Victorian Institute of Teaching</a> (VIT) as a primary teacher. If you intend to teach outside Victoria, we recommend you check registration requirements with the relevant body.</p>
            <p><strong>You may also choose to pursue a career in areas like:&nbsp;</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>children&#8217;s services coordination</li>
                <li>early childhood research</li>
                <li>policy formation</li>
                <li>quality regulation and assessment</li>

                <figcaption>Listen to Dr Tim Gilley explain how the Mid-year intake will better prepare students.</figcaption>
            </figure>
            <p>This program is undertaken in four semesters over two years. The first semester provides an in-depth opportunity to learn more about working with children in an Australian context, which will ensure you are better prepared to face the challenges of the program, most particularly during placements in early childhood settings. In turn this can help you achieve better results in the course and improve your employability in the future.</p>
            <p>If you are unfamiliar with the context of education in Australia, we recommend you take the mid-year intake option.</p>

            <p>The outcomes of the Master of Teaching (Early Childhood) differ depending on which intake you commence your studies.

            <p>The clinical model that the Master of Teaching (Early Childhood) uses and the interwoven nature of the practice and theory really attracted me. This course has given me the skills to involve children in critical reflection of the learning program. I have confidence in myself and my own abilities, and I am looking forward to gaining employment, knowing I am very prepared to teach.</p>
