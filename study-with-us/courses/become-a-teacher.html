    <p class="intro">The Master of Teaching is for graduates from any discipline who want to become teachers.</p>
    <p>Our innovative curriculum brings together theory and practice in a way that will give you powerful insights into children and young people, and how they learn.</p>
    <p><b>We are the only teaching degree in Australia to use a genuine clinical framework whereby:</b></p>
    <ul>
        <li>You become an active part of a school or early childhood community early in your studies, and are closely supported throughout. This means you can connect what you learn at university with what you learn while teaching (in a similar way to trainee doctors or nurses in a training hospital).</li>
        <li>You will develop the professional skills to assess and diagnose students’ individual learning needs, and to work with learners of all abilities.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Our unique partnership model with schools means you will spend significantly more time in schools with an unprecedented amount of support.</p>
