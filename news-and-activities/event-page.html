    <p>The term &lsquo;breaking bad,&rsquo; which originated in the American Southwest, refers to someone who defies authority or challenges convention. Many teachers have experienced challenging student behaviour, but what if that behaviour is so extreme that it puts the student or others at risk of serious harm? This presentation will outline relevant Australian laws and policy guidelines that regulate the use of &lsquo;restrictive interventions&rsquo; in educational settings. These interventions restrict a student&rsquo;s freedom of movement and can range from confinement in a room, to the use of physical force or devices.</p>
    <p>Professor McSherry will highlight some gaps in regulation, human rights implications and the difficulty in gaining accurate data in the absence of mandatory reporting of interventions. Drawing on research from the health sector, this presentation will also outline de-escalation techniques aimed at reducing the use of restrictive interventions.</p>
    <p>This lecture is hosted in partnership with the Melbourne Law School.</p>
