        <h3>Dean's Lecture Series 2016</h3><h3>Jack Keating Memorial Lecture<br />Presented by Laureate Professor John Hattie</h3><p>The too long school reforms have been focused on structural solutions such as curricula, assessment, class size, autonomy and parental choice. However, after decades of investing in these popular policy fixes the best that can be said for Australia is that the achievement and engagement of our students is declining. This lecture argues for the need to invest in teacher education, and the expertise of teachers and school leaders.</p>
